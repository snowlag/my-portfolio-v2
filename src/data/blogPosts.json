      "content": "## Introduction\n\nIn my role as a Software Engineer L2 at Metyis, I had the opportunity to work on B2B e-commerce platforms for major fashion brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. One of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of this work was optimizing the web performance to deliver a seamless user experience.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nWhen I first joined the project, the website's Dynatrace APDEX score was 0.89, which indicated room for improvement in user experience. The application was built with React and GraphQL, but it wasn't leveraging modern performance optimization techniques.\n\n## Performance Optimization Strategies\n\n### 1. Bundle Optimization\n\n**Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**\n- Implemented React.lazy() for route-based code splitting\n- Used dynamic imports for heavy components\n- Reduced initial bundle size by 40%\n\n```javascript\nconst ProductCatalog = React.lazy(() => import('./ProductCatalog'));\nconst UserDashboard = React.lazy(() => import('./UserDashboard'));\n```\n\n### 2. Preloading Strategies\n\n**Resource Hints**\n- Added `<link rel=\"preload\">` for critical resources\n- Implemented prefetching for likely next pages\n- Used preconnect for external domains\n\n### 3. GraphQL Optimization\n\n**Query Optimization**\n- Implemented query batching to reduce network requests\n- Added field-level caching with Apollo Client\n- Used GraphQL fragments for reusable query parts\n\n### 4. Component Optimization\n\n**React Performance**\n- Implemented React.memo() for expensive components\n- Used useMemo() and useCallback() for expensive calculations\n- Optimized re-renders with proper dependency arrays\n\n## Results\n\nThe optimization efforts resulted in:\n- **APDEX Score**: Improved from 0.89 to 0.95\n- **Bundle Size**: Reduced by 40%\n- **Load Time**: Decreased by 35%\n- **User Engagement**: Increased by 25%\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Measure First**: Always establish baseline metrics before optimization\n2. **User-Centric**: Focus on metrics that directly impact user experience\n3. **Iterative Approach**: Small, continuous improvements are more sustainable\n4. **Team Collaboration**: Performance optimization requires coordination across teams\n\n## Tools and Technologies Used\n\n- React 18 with Concurrent Features\n- Apollo Client for GraphQL\n- Webpack Bundle Analyzer\n- Dynatrace for monitoring\n- Chrome DevTools for profiling\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPerformance optimization is an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring and improvement. The key is to focus on user-centric metrics and implement optimizations that provide the most value to your users.\n\n*This experience taught me that performance optimization isn't just about making things faster—it's about creating a better user experience that drives business value.*",
